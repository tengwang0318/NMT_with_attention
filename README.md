Build a neural machine translation model with attention mechanism to translate Chinese into English

I used two different Chinese and English datasets. Owing to the size of datasets, so you can download it in your PC. Here are the [cmn datasets](http://www.manythings.org/anki/cmt-eng.zip) and [News-Commentary](https://opus.nlpl.eu/News-Commentary-v14.php)

I build a Nerual Machine Translation Model to tranlate Chinese into English with attention mechanism. For simplicity, I try to use letter in Chinese as token and word in English as token, but the result is sooooo bad! Then I try to use word in Chinese as token and word in English as token, after a long time to train, the test result is better than former. The result is shown in jupyter notebook output.

But the result isn't good enoughðŸ˜“.
